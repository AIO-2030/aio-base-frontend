# Git Repository Management Guide

This project is maintained in two Git repositories:
- Primary repository (origin): `git@github.com:yangsenessa/aio-base-frontend.git`
- Secondary repository (upstream): `git@github.com:yangsenessa/open-collab-space.git`

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yangsenessa/aio-base-frontend.git
   cd aio-base-frontend
   ```

2. Add the secondary repository as upstream:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:yangsenessa/open-collab-space.git
   ```

3. Verify your remotes:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

## Daily Workflow

### Pulling Latest Changes

To get the latest changes from the upstream repository:

```bash
./pull-all.sh
```

This script will:
- Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository
- Merge them into your current branch

### Pushing Your Changes

After making and committing your changes, push to both repositories:

```bash
./push-all.sh
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts when pulling:

1. Resolve the conflicts in your code editor
2. Add the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <conflicted-files>
   ```
3. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Always pull the latest changes before starting new work
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Push regularly to both repositories to keep them in sync
4. Create feature branches for new functionality

## Manual Git Commands

If you need to perform operations manually:

- Pull from upstream:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main  # or your current branch
  ```

- Push to both repositories:
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  git push upstream <branch-name>
  ```

- Check current branch:
  ```bash
  git branch --show-current
  ```

- Switch to another branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
