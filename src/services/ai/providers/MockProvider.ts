As a fallback, I'm providing this automated response. Your message was about: "${userMessage.substring(0, 100)}${userMessage.length > 100 ? '...' : ''}".

Please try again later when network connectivity has been restored. In the meantime, you can:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Use local features that don't require network access
3. Try using a different network if available

Thank you for your understanding.`;
