          <p className="mb-4">
            AIO-2030 (Super AI Decentralized Network) aims to fundamentally reconstruct the AI ecosystem and interaction paradigm. 
            By leveraging decentralized networks and blockchain technology, AIO-2030 introduces the De-Super Agentic AI Network, 
            a contract-based agent registration framework, on-chain task traceability, and incentive mechanismsâ€”ultimately 
            building an open, trustworthy, and composable AI Agent collaboration network.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            At the core of AIO-2030 lies the belief that agentic AI reasoning is driven by a Queen Agent, which orchestrates 
            cognitive processes via large language models (LLMs). Human contributors participate by providing generalized AIO-MCPs 
            (Model Capability Protocols) and assist the reasoning chain through structured inputs under the AIO Protocol.

          <p>
            The ultimate vision of Web3 + AI is to build a free and unbounded Super AI through cryptographic trust, 
            decentralized infrastructure, and collective intelligence. By aggregating decentralized AIO MCP Server nodes 
            through consensus-driven coordination, the AIO-2030 Agentic AI Network is poised to become a foundational 
            architecture capable of hosting and evolving toward Superintelligence.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            AIO-2030 establishes a unified AIO Protocol that leverages blockchain-native smart contracts to enable 
            seamless interoperability between AI Agents and MCP Servers. This framework transforms the AI ecosystem 
            from isolated intelligence to collective cognition and knowledge.
